"""Concurrent assistant creation must not surface unique violations as 500s.

``if_exists`` used to be implemented as a SELECT followed by an unconditional
INSERT. Two requests that miss the SELECT both INSERT, and the loser's
``UniqueViolationError`` escapes as a 500 — on ``assistant_pkey``,
``idx_assistant_user_assistant`` or ``idx_assistant_tenant_user_graph_config``. These
tests drive the real server against a real database so the arbitration is
exercised where it actually happens — in Postgres — rather than against a mock.
