"""Thread TTL: config resolution and expiry sweep (issue #288 phase 2).

Threads opt into a TTL via a ``thread_ttl`` row (server default on creation or
per-thread override). A background sweep claims expired rows with
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` and applies the row's strategy:

- ``delete``  — remove checkpoints then the thread row (cascades runs/crons).
- ``keep_latest`` — prune checkpoint history, keep the latest state, re-arm.

The sweep never cancels runs: threads with pending/running runs are skipped
and picked up on a later tick once their runs settle.
